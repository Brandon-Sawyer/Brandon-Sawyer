### About Me:

My name is Brandon Sawyer. I'm based in Alaska, and have always been interested in programming. As a kid, I was fascinated with the idea of using text to make a computer do anything you could think of. I'm entirely self-taught, and spend extensive amounts of time reading manuals and testing assumptions. In December 2011, I got my first programming job at a local web development company that no longer exists writing custom PHP plugins for Wordpress. These days, I do much more interesting and varied work.

### Technical Skills:

Through many years of work, I've become competent in the following languages, ranked by fluency:

* PHP
* C
* MySQL
* HTML 5 and CSS 3
* JavaScript
* PostgresQL
* Assembly
* Bash
* Python 3

I also have learned dozens of other languages to varying degrees, although I wouldn't call myself fluent in any of them.

Outside of just programming languages, I am very knowledgeable of many open-source tools, and I'm very good at reading manuals and learning new things quickly. I'm also highly knowledgeable in Linux (I've been using Gentoo and Linux From Scratch since 2014), and am very knowledgeable about blue team best security practices (for example, OWASP Top 10).
